This blog review Emi Nakamura's paper ***The Power of Forward Guidance*** published in 2016 and extend the discussion to the current Chinese context.

# Paper Review

The power of central bank forward guidance, such as promising a low interest rate in a looming economic meltdown, has been discussed by immense literature. However, the effect of forward guidance implied by basic New Keynesian model is incredible. The agents will immediately increase his consumption in response of a promise to lowering interest rate. As a result the effect accumulating for 5 years can be 18 times stronger than one in the next quarter. The unrealistic feature must be reconciled by an improved model.

The basic Keynesian model neglect the borrowing constraint emphasized by many literatures. Given this constraint, individual who want to sustain a high consumption in some period in the future would touch the bound before the implementation of policy. Moreover, the incentive of intertemporal substitution is offset by the exposure to risk of lowering assets.



Here comes to the setting of the model.
